# Garage Server

A server for Raspberry Pi to open a garage door. Used by [garage-ios](https://github.com/dillonhafer/garage-ios).

## Options

```
  -http string
    	HTTP listen address (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8225)
  -pin int
    	GPIO pin of relay (default 25)
  -version
    	print version and exit
```

## Installation Instructions

#### Installation Steps Overview:

1. Download garage-server
2. Create init.d script
3. Configure init.d script

#### 1. Download garage-server

**Install from source**

Make sure [go](https://golang.org/) is installed on your Raspberry Pi and then you can use `go get` for installation:

```bash
go get github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server
```

**Install from binary**

If you don't have/want to setup [go](https://golang.org/) on your Raspberry Pi you can download a pre-built binary. Remember to download the init.d script ðŸ˜‰

Binaries available at https://github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server/releases

#### 2. Create init.d script

Simply copy the init.d script from the src directory.

```bash
cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server/garage-server.init /etc/init.d/garage-server
```

#### 3. Configure init.d script

The last thing to do is to configure your init.d script to reflect your Raspberry Pi's configuration.

First set the `GARAGE_SECRET` environment variable. This will ensure JSON requests to the server are authenticated. Be sure to use a very random and lengthy secret.

Just un-comment the following line and add your secret in the init.d script:

```bash
# /etc/init.d/garage-server...

# Remember to set a very strong secret token (e.g. ad23384951c79a42b898e273580564d90e4eee22ad2474cf67475f323817a9ed7640a)
# DO NOT USE the above secret. It's an example only.
GARAGE_SECRET=ad23384951c79a42b898e273580564d90e4eee22ad2474cf67475f323817a9ed7640a
```

Other configuration variables to consider are the `HTTP_ADDR` and `PIN`. Use these
to set what address the web server should listen on and what GPIO pin your Raspberry
Pi is configured to use.

```bash
# /etc/init.d/garage-server...

HTTP_ADDR="0.0.0.0:8225"
PIN=25
```

Now just install and start the service:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/garage-server
sudo update-rc.d garage-server defaults
sudo service garage-server start
```

And then verify that it's running:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8225
```

should return something like:

```bash
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
garage-se 3401 root    3u  IPv4   9111      0t0  TCP *:8225 (LISTEN)
```

That's it! The server is now setup!
