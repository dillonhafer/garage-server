# Garage Server

A server for Raspberry Pi to open a garage door. Used by [garage-ios](https://github.com/dillonhafer/garage-ios).

Hardware I used for project:

1. [Magnetic Reed Switch](http://amzn.to/1XuUrV9) (Optional. Used for door status)
2. [Relay Shield Module](http://amzn.to/1NRZf1R)

I really like the above relay because when the power is disconnected and restored *(i.e. power goes out in the middle of the night)* the relay will remain off. That way a power outage won't open your garage door.
## Options

```
  -http string
    	HTTP listen address (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8225)
  -pin int
    	GPIO pin of relay (default 25)
  -status-pin int
    	GPIO pin of reed switch (default 10)
  -cert string
    	TLS certificate path (e.g. /certs/example.com.cert)
  -key string
    	TLS key path (e.g. /certs/example.com.key)
  -version
    	print version and exit
```

*NOTE: Providing a cert and key will infer the use of TLS*

## Installation Instructions

#### Installation Steps Overview:

1. **[Download garage-server](#download-garage-server)**
2. **[Create init.d script](#create-initd-script)**
3. **[Configure init.d script](#configure-initd-script)**

#### Download garage-server

**Install from source**

Make sure [go](https://golang.org/) is installed on your Raspberry Pi and then you can use `go get` for installation:

```bash
go get github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server
```

**Install from binary**

If you don't have/want to setup [go](https://golang.org/) on your Raspberry Pi you can download a pre-built binary. Remember to download the init.d script ðŸ˜‰

Latest binaries available at https://github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server/releases/latest

#### Create init.d script

Simply copy the init.d script from the src directory.

```bash
cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/dillonhafer/garage-server/garage-server.init /etc/init.d/garage-server
```

#### Configure init.d script

The last thing to do is to configure your init.d script to reflect your Raspberry Pi's configuration.

First set the `GARAGE_SECRET` environment variable. This will ensure JSON requests to the server are authenticated. Be sure to use a very random and lengthy secret.

Just un-comment the following line and add your secret in the init.d script:

```bash
# /etc/init.d/garage-server...

# Remember to set a very strong secret token (e.g. ad23384951c79a42b898e273580564d90e4eee22ad2474cf67475f323817a9ed7640a)
# DO NOT USE the above secret. It's an example only.
GARAGE_SECRET=ad23384951c79a42b898e273580564d90e4eee22ad2474cf67475f323817a9ed7640a
```

Other configuration variables to consider are the `HTTP_ADDR` and `PIN`. Use these
to set what address the web server should listen on and what GPIO pin your Raspberry
Pi is configured to use.

```bash
# /etc/init.d/garage-server...

HTTP_ADDR="0.0.0.0:8225"
PIN=25
STATUS_PIN=10
```

Now just install and start the service:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/garage-server
sudo update-rc.d garage-server defaults
sudo service garage-server start
```

And then verify that it's running:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8225
```

should return something like:

```bash
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
garage-se 3401 root    3u  IPv4   9111      0t0  TCP *:8225 (LISTEN)
```

That's it! The server is now setup!

## Updates

You can update your server with the latest binary with the `update` command in the `init.d` script.

You can keep your server automatically up-to-date with cron: 

```bash
@daily /usr/sbin/service garage-server update && /usr/sbin/service garage-server restart
```
